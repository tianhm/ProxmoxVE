## 💥 Breaking Change Advisory (only if you checked "Breaking change")

If this PR changes existing behaviour in a way that may require action before an
update, add a `breaking-change` advisory block to this PR body. The website and
the in-container update guard read it to tell operators exactly what to expect,
what to do first, and — with `action: block` — to stop an update until it's
handled. Every field is optional; the advisory auto-expires 30 days after merge.

Copy the block out of the comment below, fill it in, and paste it here:

<!--
```breaking-change
severity: warning        # info | warning | critical
action: warn             # warn (default) | block — "block" halts the update until an operator forces it
expect: One line describing what changes and why it may need action.
before_update:
  - First thing to do before updating
  - Second thing to do before updating
```

Guidance:
- Leave this commented (or delete it) for a routine change — no block, no advisory.
- Use `action: block` only for changes that break or lose data if the operator
  updates without acting first (e.g. a required manual migration or backup).
- `expect:` supersedes the auto-scraped summary; keep it to one line.
- Steps render as a checklist on the site and in the update prompt.

<!-- The advisory block is only active once it is OUTSIDE this comment. -->
